Hi! I'm Aya, a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I'm a researcher with the Designing Education Lab, led by [Professor Sheri Sheppard](https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/sheri-sheppard), and I'm conducting research at the intersection of engineering education, HCI, and accessibility. I'm very grateful to be funded and supported by the [Knight-Hennessy Scholarship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu) and the [RAISE Doctoral Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/RAISE).

My research focuses on designing, prototyping, and testing new educational technology (ed-tech) to improve the accessibility of electrical engineering education to students who are blind or have low vision (BLV). I work closely with the BLV community, and I rely heavily on my technical background in engineering as well as I do on my qualitative research skills.

I've also spent a lot of time over the past few years advocating for equitable access to tech education via multiple award-winning initiatives and projects that I've launched and led.
