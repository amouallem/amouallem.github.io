The Magical Kaleidoscope is the course project that my team and I completed for ENGR 210: Perspectives in Assistive Technology (Stanford University, Winter 2022), in collaboration with Olenka Steciw Villareal, the founder of the <a href="https://www.magicalbridge.org/discover">Magical Bridge Foundation (MBF)</a>, which creates socially inclusive and physically accessible playground experiences for visitors or all ages, sizes, and abilities. The refined prototype, under-works, will be installed at the Magical Playground in Palo Alto.

<b>Preliminary Research</b>
In collaboration with the MBF, my team and I conducted extensive research on playground attractions, natural and geometrical elements, and documented preferences and effects of colors on potential playground visitors who are color-blind, on the autism spectrum, or using wheelchairs. We adopted universal design principles to ensure that the resulting prototype would be enjoyable and accessible to all playground visitors to the greatest extent. We mainly relied on a literature review, established tests such as the Ishihara color plate test, and a survey of playground design practices to inform our preliminary research phase.

<b>Community-Based Research Practice</b>
We followed the needfinding approach to identify design criteria for our project. We regularly met with the CEO of the Magical Bridge Foundation, and we interviewed multiple potential users of our device. We also frequented the Magical Playground in Palo Alto to observe visitors' interactions with playground installations.

<b>Design Criteria</b>
We settled on the following criteria to guide our design and prototyping process:
<ul>
 <li>A small-sized, durable, secure design with height accessibility</li>
 <li>Accessible colors to avoid overwhelming the users</li>
 <li>Multiple lenses to offer the user the chance to choose what suits them best</li>
 <li>Ease of interaction</li>
</ul>

<b>Design Process</b>
We commenced by designed a low-fidelity prototype of the Magical Kaleidoscope, using toilet paper rolls, markers, and glue guns. Using our lo-fi prototype, we explored design alternatives for the placement of the rotating rod, the mounting mechanism, and the count and design of the lenses.

<b>Final Prototype</b>
We heavily utilized the Product Realization Lab (PRL) at Stanford to 3D print our CAD designs of some components, such as the handle, and to saw, paint, and drill other components. After refining our prototypes, we were able to assemble our final prototype for user testing as follows:
<ul>
 <li>The kaleidoscope body is a PVC tube which we drilled to connect the eye lugs which would hold the rotating rod. </li>
 <li>The rotating rod is controlled with a 3D printed rotating handle. We designed its flower shape to facilitate the user's ability to grip it, unlike smooth, conventional knobs, which are not as accessible. </li>
 <li>The lenses were made from acrylic, clear material and were cut using a laser cutter. The shapes on the lenses were geometrical, inspired by natural elements and the outdoor setting of the Magical Playground. Based on our research findings, to maximize color accessibility to the communities we're addressing with our design, the green color was the most preferred and the yellow color was the least preferred. Red-green color pairings in close proximity had to be avoided. </li>
 <li>We drilled the stems of the lenses and connected them of the kaleidoscope to the rotating rod. </li>
 <li>We used acrylic mirrors to construct the reflective triangular prism inside the kaleidoscope's body. </li>
 <li>We coated the device with primer and spray paint. </li>
</ul>

<b>User Testing</b>
We visited the Magical Playground in Palo Alto with our final prototype to evaluate our design criteria via playground visitors' feedback. Our users varied in age, gender, and background, but our design received collective approval and enjoyment. Users highlighted specific features such as ease of rotating the lenses, the availability of multiple lens options, the colors, and the size of the kaleidoscopes as features that they liked.

<b>Future Work</b>
Our team will be using protective coating and sealing so that the kaleidoscope can tolerate windy and rainy conditions. We will be exploring more durable lens thickness to prevent easy breakage of the lenses.
