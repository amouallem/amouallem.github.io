<b>Abstract</b>
3D CAD design is an essential component of making education and several engineering domains. However, this design process remains generally inaccessible to makers and designers who are blind and visually impaired, as it often requires the designer who is blind to 3D print a physical version of the model to receive any haptic feedback on it before iterating again to incorporate design improvements.
We propose a tool incorporating a deep learning network, inspired by the PointNet architecture, that provides textual/verbal creative feedback on the object resemblance of the designed 3D mode using multi-label classification, eliminating the need for a physical 3D printout and reducing the design iteration time and resource requirements. The network is trained on the ModelNet40 dataset with the tuning of three hyperparameters: learning rate, regularization, and batch size.
Additional data augmentation efforts can provide room for improvement in future work.
