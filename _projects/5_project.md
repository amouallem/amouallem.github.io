The MSFEA Engineering for Good Youth Summer Program at the American University of Beirut hosted in inaugural cohort in 2018. The program introduces high-school students, most of whom are first-gen or low-income (FLI) university applicants to engineering via hands-on activities hosted at AUB.

I was a lead instructor with the program, so I developed the introductory electronics curriculum and led lab workshops. I also served as a mentor to teams participating in the program's hackathon, focusing on reducing pollution in Lebanon. The three teams that I mentored won!
