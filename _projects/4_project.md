I co-founded All Girls Code (AGC) in 2017 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maya-moussa/">Maya Moussa</a> at a local coffee shop in Beirut, Lebanon. We were both sophomores in Computer Engineering, and we were questioning why so many of our friends - who happen to be women - were switching majors already. We decided to run a summer camp to test a hypothesis that we brainstormed: young girls in Lebanon do not get early exposure to hands-on tech experience the way young boys do, and that makes it unlikely for young girls to decide to pursue studies in technical fields at university and beyond.

Our summer camp attracted 100+ participants from all over Lebanon, and we were overwhelmed with the positive response from participants and their parents. One year later, we had expanded this summer camp into a full community initiative called All Girls Code, with a year-round mentorship program, an internship program, a flagship summer program called Techsplore, and events scattered year-round called Hustle Hours. AGC is fully volunteer-led, and we'll always welcome young girls from all socioeconomic backgrounds free-of-charge. These have been main distinguishing factors in comparison to the for-profit technical outreach efforts already existing in Lebanon, which we worried excluded young girls from low-income backgrounds.

Soon enough, our work was featured by local and international media, and we got to host our 2018 graduation ceremony at the Lebanese Prime Minister's residence, the Grand Serail, as AGC was selected as one of the Prime Minister's innovation initiatives for that summer.

During the pandemic, AGC shifted gears to host virtual events, which welcomed hundreds of participants from all over the Arab World. After Maya and I graduated from the American University of Beirut with our engineering bachelor's degrees, we handed the leadership positions to incredible AGC team members who had been leaders in-the-making for years now. They've been spearheading new efforts to grow the impact of AGC, and we cannot be more grateful for their work. Today, the AGC team consists of more than 40 volunteers, and AGC counts more than 700 alumni to date.

I've stepped down from being the executive director of AGC, and I'm currently serving as a member of the board of advisors. To learn more about AGC and how you can join our efforts, please visit <a href="https://www.allgirlscode.me">our website!</a>
