<b> About the Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program </b>
The HPIâ€“Stanford Design Thinking Research Program (HPDTRP) strives to apply rigorous academic methods to understand how and why design thinking innovation works and fails. The Designing Education Lab at Stanford, which I'm affiliated with, is part of the HPDTRP community and is conducting research on design education.

<b> Our Workshop </b>
At the HPDTRP conference on May 23-25, 2022, I co-led a workshop with fellow Designing Education Lab (DEL) members, Katharina Prantl (visiting researcher), Micah Lande (professor), and Helen Chen (research scientist), on assessing the impact of project-based design education in engineering on alumni, current students, and educators. This project is part of a larger research grant that DEL has received.

Our workshop consisted of a deep data-dive followed by a future outlook analysis. Participants analyzed data collected over the past 2+ decades from alumni of two project-based design courses offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford. Based on their analysis, participants explored the dynamic relationship between the academy and industry, and how project-based design education must evolve to meet the changing industrial landscape.
